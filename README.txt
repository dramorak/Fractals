/* dev notes 
- Might be a good idea to start using git for practice. 
todo:
	-performance improvement (for increased depth)
		- looking online for canvas optimizations.
		- Only increase render threshold in vicinity of mouse pointer?
		- expensively draw up to depth 8, then uniform the color and draw adum infinitum ? 

		- disable alpha
		- secondary canvas
		- eliminate canvas transform, only work with my own objects.
	- change size limiter (doesn't always seem to work as wanted? );

	bugfixes: 
		double clicking fucks up draws? 
		releasing mouse on elements other than canvas fucks up draws.
		ghost objects stick around if they're released off canvas
		crashes when too many branches are added before a trunk element is created.
		menu formatting issues on mozzilla

	UI bugfixes
		mozzilla :
			menu formatting issues on mozzilla
			scroll is very slow on mozzilla.
			custom color behaves differently on mozzilla.
			performance is a lot worse than chrome's
		edge:
	
	If I'm going to publish this website, I MUST make it mobile friendly.
	ideas:
		- change fractal center.

		- reformat tools
		- infinit scaling?  Or at least, tricking the user into thinking that they are scrolling infinitely.
		- none color type
		- coordinates
		- gridlines
		-gallery of drawings.
		-multiple fractals / supra-fractal objects
		-free form drawing
		images (png, jpeg, etc)
		copy clipboard
		text
		erasure
		share buttons
		Support for pixel perfect fractals? Maybe an advanced menu that lets the user create images using numeric values instead of an inexact GUI
