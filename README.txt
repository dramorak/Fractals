Welcome to drawFractal, a simple webapp for drawing fractals. 

Deployed app can be found at: https://branchbranchbranch.com

Purposefully built to replicate the popular graphics program 'MSPaint'. 

To begin drawing fractals, start by drawing some lines on the page. Then,
click on the 'branches' icon at the top of the menu on the left of the page.
Click and drag anywhere on the page, and voila! You've started making fractals.
Have fun exploring.
